Lab: Subnetting and IP Addressing 

Objective:  
Practice breaking a network into smaller subnets and assigning IP addresses correctly
based on given requirements.

Concepts Covered: 
- IPv4 addressing  
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation  
- Network and broadcast addresses  
- Host address ranges  

What I Worked On:  
- Calculated subnets using different subnet masks  
- Determined valid host ranges for each subnet  
- Identified network and broadcast addresses  
- Verified IP assignments to avoid address conflicts  

What I Learned:  
- How subnetting improves network organization and efficiency  
- How to calculate subnets manually instead of relying on tools  
- Why correct IP addressing is critical for network communication
