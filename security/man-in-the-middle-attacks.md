Lab: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

Objective:
Understand how Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks work and how attackers can intercept
network traffic between two communicating systems.

Concepts Covered
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Network traffic interception
- Risks of unsecured communication
- Importance of encryption and secure protocols

Tools & Environment:
- Virtual machines
- Isolated lab network
- Network monitoring and analysis tools

What I Learned:
- How MITM attacks allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate data in transit
- Why unsecured networks and plaintext communication are vulnerable
- How encryption and secure protocols help prevent MITM attacks
- The importance of network security controls and user awareness
