Lab: Firewall Rules and Network Filtering

Objective:  
Learn how firewall rules are used to control network traffic by allowing or blocking
connections based on defined security policies.

Concepts Covered:  
- Firewalls and packet filtering  
- Inbound vs outbound traffic  
- Allow and deny rules  
- Port-based filtering  
- Principle of least privilege  

What I Worked On:  
- Created firewall rules to allow specific services while blocking others  
- Controlled inbound and outbound network traffic  
- Tested rules to verify permitted and denied connections  
- Applied rule ordering to ensure correct traffic handling  

What I Learned:  
- How firewall rules protect systems from unauthorized access  
- Why rule order matters in firewall configurations  
- How restricting open ports reduces attack surface  
- How firewalls are a key part of basic network security
