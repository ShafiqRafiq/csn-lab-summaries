## Overview
This document summarizes core networking models and protocols covered in CSN205.
These concepts form the foundation of how data moves across networks and how
security controls are applied.

## Networking Models
- **OSI Model** – Conceptual 7-layer model used to understand network communication
- **TCP/IP Model** – Practical 4-layer model used in real-world networks

## Common Protocols
- **TCP** – Reliable, connection-oriented communication
- **UDP** – Fast, connectionless communication
- **HTTP / HTTPS** – Web traffic
- **DNS** – Name resolution
- **SSH** – Secure remote access

## Ports and Services
- HTTP (80)
- HTTPS (443)
- SSH (22)
- DNS (53)

## Security Relevance
Understanding protocols and models helps identify where attacks occur
and where defenses such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and encryption are applied.

## Key Takeaways
- Networking models help break down complex communication
- Protocol knowledge is critical for troubleshooting and security
- Many security tools rely on protocol and port awareness
